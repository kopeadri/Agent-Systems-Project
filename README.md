# Agent-based bacteria colony simulation

The goal of our project is to simulate the intelligent behavior of microbes in a binary substrate environment.

Our work is based on the study from the *"An agent-based learning framework for modeling microbial growth"* paper available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197602000155).


## Model will consist of:
- bacteria cells
- 2 types of food for bacteria: glucose (more efficient) and galactose (less efficient)
- different temperatures
- influence of bacteriostatic / antibacterial agents on colony

Examined bacteria: Escherichia coli


## Libraries:
- NumPy - vectorization, numerical computing
- Matplotlib - visualization, animation 
- SciPy - optimization, algebra
